						<h2 class="h2">Build & Setup</h2>
						<p>I have always been fascinated by first-person view (FPV) flight; a viewing screen or VR goggles allow you to view the flight of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS, but also read: drone) while operating its flight from the ground. In particular, I enjoy a style of flight known as “freestyle”. Freestyle flight is the culmination of movements and mechanics, interactions with physical structures, and style via the flight of a UAS. Freestyle flight is an expression of self, akin to visual and performative arts such as interpretive dance – no two flight styles (and similarly, no two drones) are the same. I have built a few drones over the years from scratch, including a “tiny-whoop” with a 75mm propeller span capable of flight indoors without damaging anything, a 5in racing-style drone for fast flights on closed courses, and a 5in freestyle drone to “dance” in the sky.</p>
						<p>Recently I got the urge to build a new freestyle drone. Typically I would be looking to build a 5in quadcopter as I enjoy the flight characteristics and achievable power that a drone of that size is capable of. But, as mentioned, I already have two 5in quads that I am happy with, and I have been eager to try flying smaller and lighter setups as these qualities lend themselves to more agile flight - specifically 3.5in. In addition to this shorter wing span, I decided I wanted my new build to fall below a 250g weight limit.</p>
						<p>As you may have guessed, I enjoy the flight characteristics of a 5in quad. The only problem is 5in quads are typically much heavier than my weight limitation. As such, in order to create a drone that met all of my requirements, I would need to scale the entire package down and create something smaller than a 5in, but much larger than the tiny-whoops in my collection. I landed on a 3.5in quad as the ideal size for this build – large enough to handle higher Kv motors, a full-feature flight controller/electronic speed controller (ESC), and a decent video transmission system, yet the parts are small and light enough to keep it under 250g.</p>
						<p>After a lot of research and calculations, the parts I used for this drone are below:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Ummagawd Botgrinder Grinderino 3.5” freestyle frame</li>
							<li>Speedybee F405 Mini BLS Stack 20mm x 20mm flight controller and ESC</li>
							<li>Ethix Flat Rats V2 1507 2800Kv motors, T-mount style</li>
							<li>ImmersionRC Ghost Atto radio transmitter</li>
							<li>Speedybee TX800 video transmitter with ImmersionRC Tramp telemetry compatibility</li>
							<li>Foxeer Razer Mini camera</li>
							<li>RushFPV Cherry MMCX RCHP antennas</li>
							<li>HQProps T3.5x2.5x3 3” propellers</li>
							<li>GNB 6s HV 120C 850mah lipo battery</li>
							<li>Eachine Pro58 radio transmission receiver with URUAV digital connection to AV output</li>
							<li>NewBeeDrone Honey patch antenna RCHP</li>
							<li>Speedybee RCHP omnidirectional antenna</li>
							<li>Radiomaster TS16s radio</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Prior to beginning any building/assembly, I like to lay out my parts to verify I have everything I will need to complete the build. I try to keep everything sorted so I can easily locate any given part. Tools were collected in a similar manner and placed on my work surface, ready to grab when needed.</p>
						
						<p>Once all of the parts and tools were gathered, I started assembling the frame. This frame only required both a 3.5mm and 5mm hex tool to put together. I like to use the iFixit bit driver and hex bits for this type of project, but individual T-drivers could also be used.</p>
						
						<p>To begin frame assembly, the carbon fiber bottom and mid plates were attached by placing the spacer block on the bottom plate and threading an M3 screw through the center press nut. This block was installed to keep the arms of the frame straight and aligned when attaching in the next step.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0413.JPG"  class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>Since the spacer block was squarely lined up between the middle and bottom plates, it created a template to slide the arms into and fasten with M3 screws threaded through the outer press nuts.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0419.JPG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>I added the various standoffs next. M3 hardware was run through the rubber spacers installed on the ESC. A longer set of M3 screws were used as the flight controller will be placed on the stack and nylon nuts will need to be attached to keep the stack in place. The taller of the two sets of frame standoffs were placed in the front of the quadcopter, while the shorter were placed in the rear.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0422.JPG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>
						
						<p>Once all of the standoffs were installed, I determined the directional layout of the fight controller and ESC. As noted above, this is a 20mm x 20mm stack, so the edges of the board would be parallel to the edges of the frame. Usually there is an arrow to indicate which side of the board should be facing forward when installed this way. NOTE: something to consider when installing your flight controller is the direction which the USB connection port is facing. Ideally it will be positioned in a way that allows easy access for connecting to the computer for configuration.</p>
						
						<p>I then mounted the motors to the arms. One motor was placed on each of the arms using the M2 screws</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0426.JPG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>Next, the motor wires were installed to the motor pads. Wires were trimmed to length, stripped, and tinned. I then tinned motor pads and soldered the wires to the ESC.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0437.JPG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>After verifying there were no bridged connections using my multi-meter, the ESC was plugged into the flight controller and the flight controller was installed onto the standoff M3 screws to complete the stack. </p>
						
						<p>Next, the battery connector was tinned and soldered to the ESC. The 6S lipo battery I am using for this particular build uses an XT30 connector. I wanted to keep enough space to easily run my video transmitter and radio transmitter wires, so I routed the battery connectors to the side of the quad which would allow my battery wire to exit in front of the rear motors and away from the propellers. Additionally, two of the trimmed motor wires from earlier were attached at each battery pad and ran out of the way so a capacitor could be attached to help mitigate voltage spikes from the battery and mitigate any associated damage.</p>
						
						<p>Next, the video transmitter and radio transmitter were connected. Since I am using a video transmitter that has the ability to be connected and controlled directly through my radio using the ImmersionRC Ghost protocol, one signal wire was connected from the Tramp pad of the Ghost Atto radio transmitter to the IRC pad of the TX800 video transmitter. My video transmitter required power, video, and ground connections, so I tinned the 5v, VTX, and ground pads of the video transmitter as well as the 5v, VTX, and ground pads of the flight controller as seen in the wiring schematics below. The radio transmitter required power, ground, and TX UART connections, so these pads were tinned accordingly. Wires were tinned and connected per this layout, and then twisted together to keep them neat and tidy once fastened into place. Antennas were connected to the video and radio transmitters to eliminate any potential damage to the transmitters upon powering the system up. A capacitor was also added to the capacitor leads stemming from the battery pads.</p>
						
						<p>The camera needed power, ground, and video connections. A 3-pin connector was used for this install. 5v, ground, and CAM pads were tinned, the wires were tinned and soldered to the flight controller, and the plug end was secured to the camera. The camera was then mounted using the 3D printed camera frames which come with the frame parts and additional M2 hardware to keep it secure and in place while flying.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0466.JPG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>Once I completed my soldering, I tested the configuration with my multi-meter to ensure there were no bridged connections, and then it was time to plug a battery into the quadcopter for its initial power-up. In order to further minimize any potential damage to my parts in the event of a bridged solder joint or reversed connection, I separated the connection between the battery and the quad using a battery fail-safe board. This board acts a circuit breaker if a short were to occur. NOTE: the antenna for the video and radio transmitters need to be connected prior to energizing – without an antenna connected, the rx/vtx can be critically damaged. </p>
						
						<p>The quadcopter powered on without any issues, so I was ready to connect to the computer to continue configuration.</p>
						
						<p>The flight controller was connected to the computer and the Betaflight Configurator application was opened. This is a frequently-updated flight configuration tool with an extremely talented team of developers who have a plethora of knowledge of FPV flight. Once plugged in and the proper comm port was selected, I was able to begin configuring the quad.</p>
						
						<p>The stock flight controller setup file was backed up and stored locally on my computer. This would allow me to flash the board with its stock configuration in the event of any unexpected issues during the flashing of new firmware. Once saved, I updated the firmware on my flight controller by selecting the proper target and most recent firmware based on the recommendations of my flight controller documentation.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/Firmware.PNG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>I then calibrated the axes of the drone using the calibration button in the Setup tab of Betaflight. This zeros the gyro on the flight controller and allows the flight controller to understand the orientation of the drone and interpret the input of the motors.</p>

						<p>Once this was complete, I bound my radio to the quadcopter. I am using the ImmersionRC Ghost protocol which requires not only a new model to be created in the radio, but a connection to the external JR module on the back of the radio. To do this, a new model was set with the internal receiver set to OFF and the external receiver set to GHOST. The bind button on the Atto was then held while plugging the battery into the drone, which sets the Atto into bind mode. Using the external Ghost radio module, I binded the Atto to the module using the SLRX2 binding method. I also opened the UART tabs to assign my radio, video, and any additional features to the UART slots on my flight controller. My radio transmitter to UART1 while my ESC was allocated to UART5. To verify the radio was communicating properly with the drone, the receiver tab in Betaflight was opened and the radio controls were operated, verifying each physical input was correctly associated with the input displayed on screen.</p>
						
						<p>Once I verified my radio and video were working without issue, I configured the motors. Two diagonally-opposite sets of motors need to be spinning clockwise, and two counterclockwise. When I tested the direction of the motors, I determined they were all spinning in the correct direction. NOTE: this would be easily corrected by reversing the direction of the motors using the Betaflight Configurator motor switches on screen in the even they were not spinning correctly.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/Motors.PNG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>Various switches from the radio were then set to functions of the drone via the Modes tab. An arming switch was allocated, which is required to be switched prior to allowing the drone to take off. A pre-arming switch was allocated, which I set to be a momentary switch that will need to be engaged prior to activating my arming switch. A switch was allocated to “turtle mode” which allows the quadcopter to automatically flip to the upright position in the event of a crash that leaves the drone upside down. This will also be tied to a beeper that will audibly signal on the drone, allowing me to locate the drone in the event that it is immobile following a crash. And finally, a flight mode switch was set, which allows me to switch between ACRO and ANGL flight modes. NOTE: ACRO is preferred for freestyle and racing flight, ANGL for cruising. ACRO will be used when operating.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/modes.PNG" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>I then switched to the OSD (on-screen display) tab in Beatflight. This tab allows me to configure what I will see on my video display when flying the quad. Important information regarding battery voltages, flight angles, GPS locations and more can be set on-screen for easy viewing in-flight. The items I like to have on screen are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>average battery cell voltages and battery meter – allow me to see how depleted the cells of my battery are and dictates when I end a flight</li>
							<li>horizontal and vertical horizon indicators – shows the levelness of the quad in flight</li>
							<li>flight mode – displays which flight mode the quad is currently in (the default preview is set to ANGL, but, as noted above, ACRO will be used when operating)</li>
							<li>arming status – the drone needs to be armed prior to each flight. This will allow me to see whether the drone was properly armed or if the arming switch was accidentally engaged for any reason</li>
							<li>VTX information – will indicate the channel my video is currently broadcasting, the power level of the video transmitter, and whether pit mode is active, limiting the output power of the video transmitter</li>
							<li>name – displays the name of the current quad in flight which allows me to sort and file blackbox flight videos</li>
						</ul>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/osd.PNG" class="img-responsive""></center></p>

						<p>Once the OSD was set how I wanted, my video receiver was powered on to verify connection to the video receiver. I am using an analog connection for my my FPV video feed using the Eachine Pro58 connected to the URUAV analog to digital converter, powered by a variable DC voltage power supply and connected to a monitor via an AC connection. This module will also allow connection to a set of FPV goggles for outdoor flight. The channel was allocated on the Ghost radio transmitter module, and the receiver was set to the matching channel. The video output was working correctly upon testing.</p>
						<p><center><img src="drone_images/IMG_0477.jpg" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

						<p>That was the last item in the initial configuration that needed competed. All settings were saved, the disconnect button was clicked, and the quad was disconnected from the computer. The top plate was attached threaded the remaining M3 screws to the frame standoffs and it was then time to take the quadcopter to a safe location, turn it on, arm it, and take a maiden takeoff flight! No issues arose during my initial flight. This means everything is functioning correctly, and I am able to fine tune and begin practicing my flight with my newly built quadcopter.</p>
