												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>Advent of Code is a unique set of coding challenges created by Eric Wastl released annually at the beginning of December. These challenges follow a holiday-themed storyline where each challenge ties into the next, with challenges growing in difficulty. Every individual participant is given a unique problem input for each day's challenge. Using any coding language of your choice, the objective is to complete all 25 days of challenges. To learn more, head over to the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> website!</p>

						<h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
						<p>The Advent of Code 2023 storyline finds you existing on a holiday-themed planet in the midst of a global snow production crisis; a planet whose wintery ecosystem depends on snow to operate. You are the lucky candidate that gets to solve this issue. In order to restore the production of snow, you need to locate and check fifty star locations (which are the likely point of hang-ups in production) using a map provided to you by the Elves whom co-exist in your world. At each point, you will be expected to correct the issues to retsore production.
						</p>

On the calendar above, each day will be shaded blue as it's completed - simply use that day's button to jump to the selected day's portion of the write-up, or just keep scrolling and read it in its entirety. Remember to check back as I continue to complete the challenges!

									<p>To begin, the Elves are going to launch you into the sky towards your first checkpoint using coordinates located on a map they have provided you. Upon making final adjustments to the trebuchet they've loaded you into, they discover their calibration document for the apparatus has been altered by a young Elf who was trying to display her art skills. It is now up to you to correct the document so that the Elves may launch you to the correct star location.</p>
									<p>This document, which originally consisted of individual lines of calibration values, is now a jumbled mess of text and numbers. The first and last digit of each line need to be combined into a two-digit number to find the original calibration values.</p>

									<p>In the first part of Day 1, I begin by importing the regex library. Regex is extremely helpful when searching, replacing, and extracting values in strings of text, and was my preferred tool in developing a solution to this problem. Once the document was imported and split into clean lines, all values which were not integers were stripped from the document, leaving only lines of numbers. Indexing each line, the first and last numbers were combined to create a single two-digit number. These numbers were placed in a list and added together resulting in the answer to the first part of Day 1.</p>

	  str_line = re.sub("[^0-9]", "", line)

	answer = f"Part 1: {sum(calibration_numbers)}"

									<p>Part 2 raises a new issue with the calibration input document. It turns out there are actually numbers speeled out in each of the lines that should also be counted when developing the list of calibration numbers. Spellings like "seven" and "four" need to appear as "7" and "4". There is an additional layer of complexity though - there are numbers that are spelled using letters from other numbers, e.g. "eightwo" need to become "82" to correctly create the calibration number.</p>
									<p>Regex was again used. This time, once divided into lines, spellings for each number were located and replaced with their respective values using a dictionary of conversions. In order to account for the combined spellings, spellings were replaced with a number indexed into each spelling (i.e. "one" was converted to "o1e", "two" to "t2o" etc.). In practice, this first turns the above "eightwo" into "e8ttwo", which will then convert the string to "e8tt2o", allowing me to extract both "8" and "2" from the line.</p>
									<p>The rest of the steps mirror part 1, removing all letters, indexing the remaining numbers, adding them to the empty calibration numbers list, and summing their values for the answer.</p>

										<p>You correctly sorted the calibration document from Day 1 and are launched to Snow Island. One problem: there is no snow on Snow Island. The Elf sent to greet you explains that there is no snow because there is no water being being delivered to the island. They mention that you will need to take a walk to the location where the issue is occurring and asks if you'd like to play a game in the meantime.</p>
										<p>This game consists of pulling different colored cubes from a sack. Each time cubes are pulled, they are counted and placed back into the sack. Each game consists of multiple pulls. Inferences can then be made on the number of cubes given the values in each pull. Your job for the first part of this day is to look at a list of game results and determine how many of these pulls are possible if there were only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes in the sack.</p>

									<p>Part 1 again begins with importing the regex library. From there, I defined an upper limit for each color cube in a dictionary - 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue as noted in the challenge. Each line was then divided using the "enumerate" function to keep a running count of each round. Using regex, color labels were found within each line, the values of which were identified by indexing the line in relation to each pull and color. If the number of cubes in each pull were less than our dictionary definitions, the ID for each game being tracked by the "enumerate" function was extracted and added to an empty "counts" variable. Once complete, the final "counts" variable is the answer to part one.</p>
<pre><code>
	import re
	def cube_counter(document):
	cube_limits = {'red': 12, 'green': 13, 'blue': 14}
	count = 0

	for id, game in enumerate(document.strip().split('\n'), start = 1):
	for num, color in re.findall(r'(\d+) (red|blue|green)', game):
		if cube_limits[color] < int(num):
		break
	else:
		count += id
	return count

									<p>Part 2 takes the same premise from above, but this time instead of determining which games are possible based on an upper limit of cubes, you need to determine the fewest number of cubes for each color that could have been in the bag to make each game possible. For example, if the results of Game 1 were "3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green", the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible. The values of each color in each row need to be multiplied together, then each of those values need added together to give the correct answer.</p>
									<p>In this solution, a zero value was assigned to each color in a dictionary. From there, once each line was split into pulls, eack pull into colors, and values were extracted for each color, the values for each color are assigned to the dictionary color value. Each value for each color in each row is compared to the last, with the highest value for each color being retained.</p>
									<p>In each iteration of the above, the values are multiplied together with that value being added to an empty counter list. Each value in this counter list is added together to give the answer to part 2.</p>

										<p>Day 3 begins with your arrival at a gondola lift station. This gondola will take you to the source of where the water for Snow Island should be. The problem is that the lift is not moving. The Elf engineer working on restoring the gondola to operating condition informs you that a part is missing from the engine responsible for powering the lift, but no one can identify which part is missing. You will need to search the engine schematic to identify the missing part.</p>

									<p>In part 2, things take a complicated turn when, after correctly identifying and installing the missing part, the engine starts running but the gondola is moving incredibly slow. It turns out that one of the gears within the engine is the incorrect gear, resulting in a gear ratio that is unable to move the gondola at the correct speed.</p>
									<p>You will now need to identify all of the gears in the parts schematic which are all "*" labels only if there are two numbers adjacent to any "*", identify those two numbers and multiply them together to get their gear ratio. These gear ratios will then need to be added together to identify which gear is incorrect.</p>
									<p>The same principle of searching each row from part 1 applied, but this time, only "*" symbols with two numbers adjacent to them were identified. The symbol was indexed, the characters in the eight surrounding indexed locations were searched, and if two separate numbers were identified, they were multiplied together with this value being added to the running total, resulting in the answer to part two.</p>

										<p>After correctly locating the incorrect gear in Day 3, you take the gondola up to a warmer, humid, less snowy location known as Island Island. You ask the greeting Elf about the water source for Snow Island. Unfortunately, this elf is only the gondola operator and does not know about the water source. They inform you that you will need to travel to speak with the gardener as they should know what the issue is. The operator proposes a deal that if you can help determine if they have won on some scratchcards they were gifted, you can take their boat to see the gardener.</p>
										<p>The Elf shows you a pile of scratchcards, each with a list of winning numbers, a divider, and a list of the player's numbers. The idea is to identify any player numbers that match any of the winning numbers. The first instance of a matching number results in one point. Any match after that doubles the point value of the card. You will need to find the total value of the Elf's cards.</p>

									<p>Regex will used in the Day 4 solutions, so installing the library is the first order of business. From there, each line can be stripped of its text and split, indexing the first set of numbers (the "winning" numbers) and the second set of numbers (the Elf's numbers). Going number by number in the Elf's numbers, they are compared to each number in the winning numbers. If one is located, a point is added to a count variable. The total value of the card can be found by raising two to the power of (count - 1). For example, if only one matching number was identified, two would be raised to (1 - 1), or zero, reuslting in a single point. Two matching would be two raised to (2 - 1), 1, resulting in a value of 2, and so on.</p>
									<p>The total value for each card is then added together, resulting in the answer to part 1 of Day 4.</p>

										<p>You successfully solved Day 4 and are able to take the boat to see the gardener. The gardener informs you that there is no one specific location on Island Island that is the source of Snow Island's water, the entirety of Island Island is the source. The gardener also mentions that they ran out of sand to filter the water, so no water is able to be supplied in its current unfiltered state. Fidning why no sand is being supplied to Island Island for their filtration got put on the back burner while the gardener was busy keeping up with food production for Island Island's inhabitants. They ask you to take a ferry to the sand supply location.</p>
										<p>While waiting for the ferry, the gardener asks for your help solving their food production problem and hands you the Island Island Almanac, which is your input for the Day 5 challenges. This almanac lists all of the seeds which need to be planted and all of those seeds' associated soils, fertilizer, planting locations, humidity, light values, etc. The almanac contains a map which describes how each value in the source numbers is associated to a planting destination.</p>

										<p>The all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island turns out to be a one-way trip. Upon arrival, an Elf inquires about whether you had brought the parts to fix the sand issues. They tell you to get on their camel with them to ride to the location of the issue. This journey will take a few days, so the Elf teaches you a card game called "Camel Cards". This game is similar to five-card poker, except there are no suits and there is a possibility to get five of a kind. Five of a kind beats four of a kind, which beats a full house, which beats three of a kind, which beats two pair, which beats a pair, which beats high card. If two hands have the same type, you compare each card in order to see which is higher. Once a card in that hand is higher than the other, the hand with the higher value card wins.</p>
										<p>To play, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid. You will need to develop a way to check and rank each hand, assign a ranking value to each, and multiply the bid by the ranking value. You then need to determine the total winnings for your set of hands.</p>

									<p>In order to check and rank each card, a few tools from the numpy, collections, and functools libraries need to be imported. This allowed me to count and sort the long list of hands. I started by allocating a value to each hand type and checking each individual hand in my input against it. Five of a kind returned a value of 5, four of a kind a value of 4, and so on.</p>
									<p>From there, once each hand had a value, they could be sorted. If more than one hand had the same value, each card was evaluated starting at the begining and ranked each individual card as a nested ranking order. Once these were sorted, they were placed back into the overall ranking sytem and the program continued. Once the hands were listed from strongest to weakest, their bids were multipled by their ordered place, and the sum of all multiplied values was recorded as the final answer to part 1.</p>

									<p>To make things interesting, the Elf lets you know that now "J" cards are jokers and that these can be considered wildcards. They can be used to match any card that gives the best hand, but when used for tie-breakers, they count less than the lowest value card (a "2"). With these new rules, the totals needed to be recalculated.</p>
									<p>The ranking system used previously would still work, but while passing the input through the function, "J"-value cards would need to be addressed. Once the cards are sorted by order, if a "J" was present, the card with the most value in the individual hand would be matched by the "J". The function ranked the cards as it did in the first part, but this time would adjust the value for "J" accordingly in tie-breakers. Sorting, bid multiplication, and total calculations were all the same once sorted and ranked to give me the answer for part 2.</p>
